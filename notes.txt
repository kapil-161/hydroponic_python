# Hydroponic Python Model Fixes - August 21, 2025

## Critical Issues Fixed Today:

• **Fixed thermal time scaling error** in phenology_model.py
  - Changed thermal_time_scale from 1.4 to 1.0 (line 81)
  - Corrected temperature factor calculation to use actual thermal time ratio (lines 255-260)
  - Added validation for thermal_time_scale parameter (0.8-1.2 range)

• **Fixed photosynthesis model unit inconsistencies** in photosynthesis_model.py
  - Added proper O2 concentration parameter (o2_mmol_mol = 210.0)
  - Added realistic internal CO2 fraction (ci_fraction = 0.75)
  - Fixed respiration integration to subtract 24h dark respiration from photoperiod gross photosynthesis
  - Clarified O2 unit conversion (mmol/mol → μmol/mol) with explicit variable

• **Fixed nutrient transport model** in nutrient_models.py
  - Removed temperature effects from transport capacity calculation
  - Applied Q10 temperature response only to transport kinetics (rates)
  - Fixed redistribution tracking to use signed net flux instead of absolute values

• **Fixed root activity decay model** in root_system_model.py
  - Replaced exponential decay with half-life based model
  - Added early-life plateau (no decline for first week)
  - Increased minimum activity levels (20-30% instead of 5%)
  - Reduced Q10 factor from 2.0 to 1.6 for root uptake

• **Fixed stress model logic inversion** in stress_models.py
  - Corrected acute stress calculation (lines 589-613)
  - Fixed inverted relationship where lower stress levels gave lower stress factors
  - Added clear documentation for stress level conventions

• **Standardized stress level vs factor conventions** in cropgro_hydroponic_simulator.py
  - Stress Levels: 0.0 = no stress, 1.0 = maximum stress
  - Stress Factors: 1.0 = optimal, 0.0 = severe stress
  - Eliminated duplicate temperature stress calculations
  - Fixed all stress conversions between models

• **Added parameter bounds validation**
  - Added _validate_parameter() method to photosynthesis model
  - Added _validate_thermal_scale() method to phenology model
  - Parameters now checked against biological bounds with warnings for invalid values

• **Fixed integration flow issues**
  - Removed redundant stress calculations in main simulator
  - Fixed growth factor calculations for root development
  - Standardized stress factor usage across all physiological models
  - Eliminated inconsistent unit conversions between models

## Issues Resolved:
- Thermal time scaling factor of 1.4 was distorting GDD calculations
- Photosynthesis O2 concentration units were inconsistent (ppm vs μmol/mol)
- Internal CO2 calculation was oversimplified (assumed = ambient)
- Stress model logic was inverted, causing unrealistic responses
- Root activity decay was too aggressive, making roots inactive too quickly
- Temperature effects were applied incorrectly to nutrient transport capacity
- Stress levels and factors were used inconsistently across models
- Duplicate calculations created inconsistent model integration

## Model Reliability Improvements:
- Phenology: Thermal time calculations now biologically accurate
- Photosynthesis: Proper CO2/O2 competitive inhibition with correct units
- Stress Response: Realistic stress factor calculations
- Root Architecture: Proper activity decay and environmental responses
- Integration: Consistent data flow between all subsystem models
